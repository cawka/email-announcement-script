In this talk, I present interesting problems in biological systems and my work in solving them using computational methods. As an engineer trained in ECE, and a scientist trained in CS, I have looked at the questions pertaining to molecular systems that biologists seek answers to by drawing parallels to problems addressed in language technologies and network analyses. We have studied n-gram language modeling to detect genetic signatures and repetitive regions, latent semantic analysis to identify transmembrane helices in proteins, and social network analysis to predict edges in the human protein interactome. These approaches have been translated to experimentally validated results of biomedical significance. Specifically, they led to the discovery of the protein that plays a crucial role in viral immunity, identified two drugs (which treat allergies and motion sickness) to be potentially repurposable for Schizophrenia and are under clinical trials, and identified network modules that point to the role of specific organelles in a complex disease called congenital heart disease.  My current research is on the discovery of molecular interactome, on prioritizing our computational predictions, and on effectively disseminating the results to suitable biologists. The talk will not assume any audience background in biology, and it would be made interesting to computer scientists as well as to biomedical scientists. \n\nBio: Madhavi Ganapathiraju received Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science in Language and Information Technologies, M.
