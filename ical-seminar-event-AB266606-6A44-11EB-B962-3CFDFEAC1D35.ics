DESCRIPTION:https://fiu.zoom.us/j/97615645408?pwd=VnJybXBUUFgyK1dNL0ZoWFRTd2ZUZz09\nMeeting ID: 976 1564 5408, Computer Passcode: S#e!mi%21 , Phone call Passcode: 592224389\n\nTitle: Security\n\nAbstract: The Web has redefined the way in which malicious activities such as online harassment, disinformation, and radicalization are carried out. To be able to fully understand these phenomena, we need computational tools able to trace malicious activity as it happens and identify influential entities that carry it out. In this talk, I will present our efforts in developing tools to automatically monitor and model malicious online activities such as coordinated aggression and disinformation. I will then discuss possible mitigations against these harmful activities, keeping in mind the potential unintended consequences that might arise from suspending offending users.\n\nBio: Gianluca Stringhini is an assistant professor in the ECE Department at Boston University. Gianluca works in the area of data-driven security, analyzing large datasets to better understand complex malicious online operations and developing mitigation techniques to fight them. He received mupltiple prizes including an NSF CAREER Award in 2020, and his research won multiple Best Paper Awards, including one at IMC 2018. He has published over 100 peer reviewed paper including several in top security conferences such as IEEE Security and Privacy, CCS, NDSS, and USENIX Security, as well as top measurement and Web conferences such as IMC, ICWSM, and WWW.\n
