Mark your calendar: Spooky Tea-Time Meetup: Dreadful Research in the Solid Lab

Dear faculty and students,

We are launching a new series of tea-time research meetups on Wednesdays 2pm, which we aim to be a more informal conversation between faculty, students, and occasional distinguished guests than our regular seminar talks.  Of course, we will be refining the format as we go and the first meetup will be next Wednesday, October 28, 2020 at 2pm.  The featured guest of the meetup will be Hadi Amini and his students, talking about his lab, dreadful or not research issues that his lab is working on, and any other topic that will come up during the conversation.  Note that these series will not be recorded.

This week's theme will be Halloween, so in order to participate you are required to either wear a halloween costume, have a Halloween themed photo in zoom, or Halloween-themed virtual background.
