      <h3>Abstract:</h3>
      <p>Computing has changed from compute-centric to data-centric. From deep-learning to visualization, data access becomes the main performance concern of computing. In this talk, based on a series of fundamental results and their supporting mechanisms, we introduce a new thought on memory system design. We first present the Concurrent-AMAT (C-AMAT) data access model to quantify the unified impact of data locality, concurrency and overlapping. Then, we introduce the pace-matching data-transfer design methodology to optimize memory system performance. Based on the pace-matching design, a memory-computing hierarchy is built to generate and transfer the final results, and to mask the performance gap between computing and data transfer. C-AMAT is used to optimize performance at each memory layer, and a global management algorithm, named Layered Performance Matching (LPM), is developed to optimize the overall performance of the memory system. The holistic pace-matching optimization is very different from the conventional locality-based system optimization, and can minimize memory-wall effects to the minimum. Experimental testing confirms the theoretical findings, with a 150x reduction of memory stall time. We will present the concept of the pace-matching data-transfer design, the design of C-AMAT and LPM, experimental case studies, and results on DoE and NASA applications. We will also discuss optimization and research issues related to pace-matching data access and to memory systems in general.
