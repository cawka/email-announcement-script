DESCRIPTION:https://fiu.zoom.us/j/3053484802?pwd=VDhKLzJIck0wK0xZMFVxQ2lSUmVvZz09\nMeeting ID: 305 348 4802, Computer Passcode:  case349, Phone call Passcode: 5522441\n\nTitle: Speech-Based Digital Biomarkers: Opportunities and Challenges\n\nAbstract: Recent projections indicate that the number of connected Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, sensors, and actuators will pass 46 billion in 2021 and people will interact with these devices on a daily basis, e.g., to monitor and control our health, homes, connected vehicles, security systems, social interactions, and almost every other aspect of our lives. As one of the most natural ways of communications, speech has recently found a rapidly increasing interest as a primary mode of interaction between humans and IoT devices. At the same time, recent research has shown that speech analysis can be used for more than just speech and speaker recognition. That is, analysis of prosodic clues in recorded speech suggests that the human voice can be used as a biomarker for various neurological and psychological impairments. Further, speech analysis can he used to determine the intent and levels of frustration or anxiety a user experiences when interacting with an IoT system. In this talk, I will discuss several opportunities, challenges, and applications of speech-based IoT systems, including the development of digital biomarkers based on speech and potential security concerns posed by voice assistants.\n\nBio: Chris Poellabauer is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, which he joined in 2004.
