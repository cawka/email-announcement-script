Topic: Distributed Machine Learning Algorithms for Resource-Constrained Heterogeneous
  Internet-of-Things Environments
Abstract: The ubiquitous nature of IoT devices causes huge data streams due to their
  widespread applications. Storing and processing such vast amounts of data in a centralized
  location is costly and time-consuming. To attain a better ML model under the conventional
  centralized approach, the users may need to compromise their privacy by sharing
  their private data with data centers. Federated Learning (FL) is emerging due to
  its capabilities as a distributed machine learning training over a network of available
  devices. Though FL has a unique way of generating a cumulative global model by learning
  from the client's model parameters, it has distinctive challenges from conventional
  distributed optimization, such as system heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity,
  particularly while applying FL in resource-constrained IoT environments. Due to
  such heterogeneity, if we deploy the FL algorithms in an IoT environment (with potentially
  several IoT agents that have limited local computing resources), then most of the
  IoT devices may turn into stragglers, and consequently, the FL process may be hampered.
  Besides, as the IoT devices are vulnerable and prone to attacks, they may generate
  inappropriate models that may prolong the model convergence and exhaust the resources
  of the participating FL devices. To address these challenges, my research focuses
  on leveraging an effective FL model that can handle heterogeneous IoT devices tackling
  the challenges that arise from systems heterogeneity, and statistical heterogeneity
  such as straggler issues, large data across the networks, diverge model infusion,
  or issues with dealing with global model aggregation.
