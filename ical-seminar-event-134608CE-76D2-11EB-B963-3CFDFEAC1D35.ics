DESCRIPTION:https://fiu.zoom.us/j/3053484802?pwd=VDhKLzJIck0wK0xZMFVxQ2lSUmVvZz09\nMeeting ID: 305 348 4802, Computer Passcode:  case349, Phone call Passcode: 5522441\n\nTitle: Communicating Call Types Through Universal Design\n\nAbstract: Spam calls can be disruptive, create communication hardship, and sometimes deceive users into financial loss. Since Caller ID is unreliable but often used to determine the validity of a call, researchers and practitioners have suggested using authenticated Caller ID to reduce the problem. Although carriers are working to implement this technology, there is currently no standard for communicating the legitimacy of Caller ID information to users. This talk will focus on the universal design of incoming call warnings. First, we investigate how mobile device users with and without visual impairment detect spam calls without authenticated Caller ID. Next, we identify usersâ€™ spam call management needs and how anti-spam applications currently meet those needs. Finally, we test and evaluate the effectiveness of various user-created visual warnings. We find that meeting the usability needs of users through universal design practices can create effective warnings that influence user reactions to different call types.\n\nBio: Imani Sherman is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Florida in the Human-Centered Com- puting program. She received a Master of Science in Computer Science from Kentucky State University and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Dayton.
