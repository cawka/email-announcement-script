abstract: |
        Emerging technologies and applications including Internet of Things (IoT), social networking, and crowd-sourcing generate a large amount of data at the network edge. Machine learning models are often built from the collected data, to enable the detection, classification, and prediction of future events. Due to bandwidth, storage, and privacy restrictions, it is often impractical to send all the data to a central location. In this talk, we present a recent technique, known as federated learning, that enables model training from decentralized data distributed across multiple edge nodes, without sending raw data to a central place. We first describe the basic federated learning procedure that is based on distributed gradient descent, then discuss several ways of enhancing the communication and computation efficiency of federated learning. The talk covers both theoretical and practical (systems) aspects of federated learning. Some open challenges and other related work are also outlined at the end of the talk.
