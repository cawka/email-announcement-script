abstract: |
        The challenges of women in science and engineering in India stand distinct from that of the West and other developed countries. Post – Independence, India has documented the glaring gender gaps spread across educational levels. India has made systematic interventions to close this gap; however the progress made thus far further points to anomalies that have drawn the attention of researchers. India has adopted a two way strategy to promote formal education in the country. On the one hand, it ensured that access to formal education was provided to all across caste, class and gender. At the same time the country also promoted science and technology in an attempt to catch up with the West. This dual policy had an interesting impact on how gender gaps played out across the years. India presents an unique challenge, as the problem for Indian science was not in attracting young girls to science and engineering but to focus on the ways in which the rising number of women in science can be reflected in formal work spaces. Hence there was a need to shift focus to institutional spaces and interrogate the diverse ways in which women respond to these challenges. Important dimensions of work life balance, changing caste, class & gender relations, growing number of women in these institutions, leadership styles and the history of the institutions also seem to interact in interesting ways making the field of study complex and unique. How one unfolds these complexities and make attempts to provide possible explanations will be focus of the presentation.
