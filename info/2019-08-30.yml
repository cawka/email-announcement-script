topic: "Distributed Optimization and Learning for Intelligent Interdependent Networks"
abstract: "Increasing integration of modern technologies in the smart city infrastructures requires comprehensive models and efficient computational methods to deal with the complex optimization and learning problems. Currently, there is a need for control centers to solve large-scale optimization and learning problems. This increases the computational complexity and requires extensive information sharing. The first part of this talk is devoted to distributed/decentralized methods. These algorithms introduce three major advantages as compared with the prior works: 1) reducing the computational complexity of the large-scale optimization problems, 2) preserving the information privacy of entities over the network, and 3) enabling scalability and plug-and-play capability. The key advantage of the proposed methods is to eliminate the control centers and distribute computing among agents, i.e., in our proposed solutions, each agent/node will only exchange local information with a limited number of agents.
Second part of this seminar is devoted to applications of decentralized/distributed algorithms in real-world interdependent networks. Our ultimate goal is to understand the concept of ‘interdependent decision making’ and design tailored algorithms to efficiently solve them. Application domains include energy systems and transportation networks.
Third part of this talk provides a big picture of ongoing projects at Sustainability, Optimization, and Learning for InterDependent networks laboratory (solid lab) at FIU SCIS and potential opportunities for motivated students to work on cutting-edge research problems.
