abstract: |
        Modern geometry has been providing powerful tools to solve real-world geometric analysis tasks. These tasks can be 3D face recognition and expression analysis, brain morphometry analysis for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, polyp screening in virtual colonoscopy, cardiac motion analysis, sensor routing in 3D wireless environments, and the like. The central of such tasks is to compute the shape representation of a surface and the shape metric between the surfaces, as is also the kernel of quasiconformal Teichmüller geometry theory. 
        This talk focuses on the theory and the computational algorithms of quasiconformal Teichmüller geometry, and their applications in practice. Teichmüller theory has its unique merits: (a) shapes in real life can be classified in Teichmüller space, because shapes with the same geometric structures are very rare; and (b) there exist a unique optimal mapping between surfaces, Teichmüller map, and a unique metric, Teichmüller metric, for shape registration and shape comparison and classification, respectively. They have offered powerful tools for shape registration, recognition, classification, and analysis, and have been widely applied in engineering and medicine. The future research goal is to explore the geometric viewpoint of machine learning based on the theories of optimal mass transport and Ricci flow and the discrete 3-manifold Ricci flow theory, for high volume geometric processing and learning tasks.
