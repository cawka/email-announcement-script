abstract: |
        Modern geometry has been providing powerful tools to solve real-world geometric analysis tasks to achieve more efficiency and accuracy. These tasks can be 3D face recognition and expression analysis, brain morphometry analysis for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, polyp screening in virtual colonoscopy, cardiac motion analysis, sensor routing in 3D wireless environments, and the like. The central of such tasks is to compute the shape representation of a surface and the shape metric between the surfaces, as is also the kernel of quasiconformal Teichmüller geometry theory. Teichmüller theory studies deformations of geometric structure on a surface; the Teichmüller space is a universal classification space for the complex structures with given quasiconformal type and itself has a natural complex structure, where, a point denotes a class of surfaces and a curve denotes a deforming path between two classes. It offers a powerful tool for shape registration and geometric analysis, which plays fundamental roles in a broad range of applications in engineering and medicine.
        This talk focuses on the theory and the computational algorithms of quasiconformal Teichmüller geometry, and their applications in practice. Teichmüller theory has its unique merits: (a) due to shapes in real life with the same geometric structures (i.e., within a Teichmüller equivalence class) are very rare, they can be classified in Teichmüller space; and (b) in Teichmüller space, there exist a unique optimal mapping, Teichmüller map, which describes shape deformation for shape registration, and a unique metric, Teichmüller metric, which describes shape difference for shape comparison and classification. Teichmüller theory has been used to tackle the following fundamental problems in engineering and biomedicine: 3D human face registration and deformable surface tracking in computer vision; curve/graph-constrained surface parameterization in computer graphics; landmark-curve driven structural visualization for brain mapping and virtual colonoscopy in medical imaging; Teichmüller coordinates for brain-Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis and brain-intelligence analysis, routing and load balancing in wireless sensor network, spline reparameterization in geometric modeling, and so on. The future research is to explore the geometric viewpoint of machine learning based on the optimal mass transport theory and Ricci flow theory, to develop discrete 3-manifold Ricci flow, and to investigate their efficiency and accuracy for real-time geometric processing and learning tasks.
