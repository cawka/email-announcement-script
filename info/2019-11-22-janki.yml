abstract: |
        A new era of "Data Age" is approaching today. Data is the fuel for analytics of all the emerging technologies of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Data management plays a critical role in delivering real-world impacts. However, it is challenging for any systems to efficiently manage data to achieve low latency, high throughput, and good endurance. A good ecosystem is highly demanded to provide fine coordination among multiple facets of the system, such as parallel computing, hierarchical memory caching, and low I/O latency storage. Mitigating bottlenecks at each facet/layer is essential for accelerating overall production-scale deployments. Therefore, in this talk, I will present our research that aims to develop new data management techniques and schemes for building an efficient and reliable computing system for data-intensive applications. Specifically, there are three main components of data management, i.e., data generation, data categorization, and data storage. I will first introduce our primary research focus related to these three data management components. Then, I will mainly elaborate on two research works. First, I will discuss our framework that we are designing to capture enterprise SSD behavior encapsulating various real workloads and system configurations. Second, I will present our new key-value based storage infrastructure for parallel computing using emerging key-value SSDs for accelerating OpenMP high-performance computing (HPC) applications. Finally, I will discuss the challenges in efficient and reliable management of upcoming heterogeneous data-centric computing requirements and possible approaches toward developing infrastructures to accommodate these future requirements.
