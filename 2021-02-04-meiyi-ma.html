      <h3>Abstract:</h3>
      <p>AI-powered Cyber-Physical Systems (AI-CPS) form the basis of emerging and future smart services, improve quality of life, and bring advances in many critical areas, including smart cities and health care. A central problem is how to build reliable AI-CPS facing significant new challenges due to the increasing complexity, integration, and environmental uncertainties. In this talk, I will present my approaches to developing rigorous and robust models for reliable AI-CPS by integrating formal methods and deep learning. First, I will give a brief overview of an AI-CPS decision-support system incorporating integrative solutions to improve its capability and reliability. This system is to be deployed in Newark City, connecting to the Mayor's dashboard for conflict detection and resolution among smart services. Second, I will describe two of the key formal methods enhanced deep learning techniques from the system. The first technique increases the robustness of sequential prediction by incorporating formal specification and verification to the learning process, which is a powerful method to guide the network to follow critical CPS model properties. The second technique creates a novel specification logic to measure the uncertainty in deep learning with a confidence guarantee. It then applies the logic-based criteria to automatically calibrate the uncertainty estimation model for deep learning. I will also show the generalizability of these techniques for various neural networks and applications. I will conclude my talk with a brief discussion of my future research directions on further integrating formal methods and deep learning towards explainable, verifiable, and reliable AI-CPS addressing a broad spectrum of social and technical challenges. </p>
