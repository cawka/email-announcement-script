DESCRIPTION:https://fiu.zoom.us/j/3053483751?pwd=aWdMbGUxM3BoODRBcXNVV29DR2Ixdz09\nMeeting ID: 305 348 3751 Computer Passcode: Dec04Mtg Phone call Passcode: 86662929 \n\nTitle: Eigenvector Centrality-based Mobile Target Tracking\n\nAbstract: In this presentation, we will look at an application of the eigenvector centrality (EVC) metric for tracking a mobile target (a radiological dispersal device: RDD) with the aid of wireless sensor networks. We assume the sensor nodes to be capable of sensing the strength of the radioactive signals in the surroundings, including those emanating from a mobile RDD. We propose that the sensor nodes sum up the strengths of the signals sensed in the neighborhood over a sampling time period and forward the sum of the signals to a control center (called sink). Assuming that the sink knows the topology of the entire sensor network, for every sampling time period, the sink constructs an adjacency matrix in which the entry for edge (i, j) is the sum of the signal strengths reported by sensor nodes i and j. The sink uses this adjacency matrix as the basis to determine the principal eigenvector whose entries represent the eigenvector centralities (EVC) of the vertices with respect to the radioactive signals sensed in the neighborhood. We hypothesize that sensor nodes that have a high EVC (suspect nodes) for the sampling time period are within the vicinity of the RDD within that period. We propose that the arithmetic mean (calculated by the sink) of the X and Y coordinates of the suspect sensor nodes be considered as the predicted location of the RDD at a time instant corresponding to the middle of the sampling time period. We evaluate the difference between the predicted and exact locations of the RDD trajectory over time as a function of different operating parameters (such as the RDD velocity, the transmission and sensing range of the nodes and the duration of the sampling time period).\n\nBio: Dr. Natarajan Meghanathan is a tenured Full Professor of Computer Science at Jackson State University, Jackson, MS.
