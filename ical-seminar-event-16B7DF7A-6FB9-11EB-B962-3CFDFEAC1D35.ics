DESCRIPTION:https://fiu.zoom.us/j/3053484802?pwd=VDhKLzJIck0wK0xZMFVxQ2lSUmVvZz09\nMeeting ID: 305 348 4802, Computer Passcode:  case349, Phone call Passcode: 5522441\n\nTitle: Toward a Unified Framework for Human-like Machine Learning\n\nAbstract: Developing human-like machine learning systems is important in modern machine learning since such systems can leverage both human abilities and computer capabilities to train machine learning models in an automated and cost-efficient way. In this talk, I will argue that probabilistic inference, particularly Bayesian inference methods, can provide a unified framework for building human-like machine learning systems that can integrate many separate research areas in the field. As case studies, I shall discuss in details two aspects of human-like machine learning: continual learning and active learning, and show how Bayesian inference can be used to develop novel continual learning and active learning algorithms that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective for several real-world applications. Finally, I will outline some future research directions toward building human-like machine learning systems.\n\nBio: Cuong Nguyen is an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services (AWS), working on machine learning and computer vision. Before joining AWS, he was a postdoc at the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering, National University of Singapore and then at the Department of Engineering, Cambridge University. He received B. Comp. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science both from the National University of Singapore in 2010 and 2015 respectively. His research interests include probabilistic machine learning and AI, with applications to real-world problems in computer vision and natural language processing. He has regularly published at top conferences in machine learning/AI, including NeurIPS (formerly known as NIPS), ICML, ICLR, UAI and AAAI.\n
